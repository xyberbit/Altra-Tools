Recovery

  When grub.cfg can't be loaded from efi partition, grub normal mode helps as long as the grub.cfg in root partition is accessible.

  1. Locate the root partition.
     grub> for i in (*,*)/boot/grub/grub.cfg; do echo $i; done
     If multiple roots found, identify the root by its filenames and contents of files.
     let's take (hd2,gpt2) as an example.

  2. Configure grub and enter normal mode. (insmod is optional if normal module loaded)
     grub> root=(hd2,gpt2)
     grub> prefix=/boot/grub
     grub> insmod normal
     grub> normal
